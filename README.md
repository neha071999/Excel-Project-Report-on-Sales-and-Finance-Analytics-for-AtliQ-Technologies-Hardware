# Project Report: Excel Project on Sales and Finance Analytics for AtliQ Technologies Hardware
Hi, everyone. I am so excited to be able to share the details of my latest project, "Excel Project Report on Sales and Finance Analytics for AtliQ Technologies Hardware," with all of you. So, this was a nice project because it allowed me to apply in real-time, really, the learnings I had from the course "Excel: Mother of Business Intelligence." The primary contents of the project are:
## Sales Report
The sales report carries comprehensive analyses of the various aspects of AtliQ Technologies' sales performance. The report is built up of several vital sections:
1.	Customer Performance Report: This section will broadly analyze customer performance metrics covering how key customers contribute to overall sales and their contribution trends over time.
2.	Market Performance Vs. Target: Comparison of actual market performance data with the targets provides light on areas of overperformance and underperformance.
3.	Top 10 Products: An elaborate report on the top 10 products according to the sales metrics highlights well-performing products.
4.	Division-level reporting: Looking at Sales performance sliced by different divisions in the company to get an understanding of the contribution of each division in a more granular form.
5.	Top & Bottom Products by Quantity: Enable you to know what products are at the peak and base when it comes to sales quantity to focus strategies for inventory and sales improvement.
6.	New Products by 2021: Performance review of the products newly launched into the market in 2021: Market response and sales trend.
7.	Top 5 Countries by 2021: A report on countries making the most sales in 2021, bringing out a geographical perspective of the sales distribution.
## Finance Report
The finance report concentrates on the financial health and performance of AtliQ Technologies, segmented in various insightful ways:
1.	P & L Year by Fiscal Year: Profit and Loss statements for each fiscal year, offering a year-over-year comparison of financial performance.
2.	P & L Month by Fiscal Year: A Monthly Profit and Loss breakdown in each fiscal year, every quarter, which will allow one to observe views of the financial trends in-depth, including whether any seasonal patterns appear.
3.	P & L by Markets: The Profit and Loss presented at levels of different markets allows one to understand in detail the financial performance of those different regions.
4.	GM% by Quarters (sub-zone): Analysis of Gross Margin percentage by quarters, broken up into sub-zones, to monitor the profitability trend and also to identify some areas for improvement.
## Skills and Techniques Applied
Throughout this project, I have applied several Excel skills and techniques. Some include:
•	Basic and Advanced Formulas: Used SUM, IF, SUMIF, CALCULATE, DIVIDE, IFERROR, VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, and INDEX MATCH.
•	Data Handling and Cleaning: Managed the data most efficiently, using tables, filter and sort features, and conditional formatting. The more detailed parts of these tasks were done using the Power Query tool for advanced cleaning and merging.
•	Data Visualization: Created dynamic charts and pivot tables for effective presentation of data. Power Pivot has been used for advanced data modeling.
•	Business Metrics Analysis: Analyzed the critical business metrics, including Profit & Loss statements, COGS, Gross Margin, and Gross Margin%
•	Advanced Excel Tools: Utilized Power Query in the tasks for data cleaning, merging, and transformation while effectively employing ETL processes for integration and transformation of data.
•	ETL Processes: Used Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to efficiently integrate and transform data into clean and precise datasets.
•	M Language: Worked with the M language in Power Query for complex data transformation tasks; therefore, I could achieve sophisticated data cleaning and shaping operations.
•	DAX Queries: Used Data Analysis Expressions to apply complex query filters and create reports using query functionalities that satisfied stakeholder needs.
•	Power Pivot: I created data models and the relationship between datasets in Power Pivot to enhance the ability to do in-depth analysis of data with good reporting.

This project has proved to be a great learning experience for me, which helped me reinstate my Excel features at the Business Intelligence and Analytics level. I would like to translate these learnings into action towards driving and empowering data-driven decision-making that, in turn facilitates AtliQ Technologies to achieve increased organizational effectiveness and successful business performance improvement.
